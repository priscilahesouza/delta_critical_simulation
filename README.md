# delta_critical_simulation

This repository contains the Python code and numerical simulations used in the paper:

**"Sustaining Cooperation in Orbital Commons: A Repeated Game Approach with Finite Punishment"**

The simulations compute the critical discount factor (Î´_crit) required to sustain cooperation in orbital commons, based on detection probability (p) and punishment duration (T).
